sdesc: "Fakes the system date"
ldesc: "This program (and preload library) fakes the system date so that 
programs think the wall clock is ... different. The faking is not 
complete; timestamp on files are not affected in any way. This package 
is useful if you want to test the date handling of your programs without 
changing the system clock."
